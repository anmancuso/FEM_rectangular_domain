# Finite Element Method for Homogeneous Poisson Equation

### Python Scientific Developer Assessment - FEM 

This repository contains a Python implementation of the finite element method (FEM) for solving the homogeneous Poisson equation in a rectangular domain. The solver is implemented in `solver.py`, and its application is demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook `FEM_Demo.ipynb`.

Description
The solver addresses the following problem:

$$
-Î”u(x) = f(x) \quad \forall x \in \Omega := [a, b] \times [c, d]
$$

with the boundary condition:

$$
u(x) = 0 \quad \forall x \in \partial\Omega
$$


The implementation focuses on:

- Using essential libraries like scipy and numpy for computations.
- Analyzing the method's convergence with a test case.
- Visualizing results using matplotlib or plotly.
- Refining meshes based on convergence theory to enhance solution accuracy.

## Key Functions
### solver.py

####  `create_rectangular_triangle_mesh(a, b, c, d, nx, ny)`
Creates a regular grid of right-angled triangles, which is a common requirement in finite element analysis. The function generates a mesh over a rectangular domain by dividing it into a grid of right-angled triangles.

- **Parameters**:
  - `a, b`: x-axis range.
  - `c, d`: y-axis range.
  - `nx, ny`: Number of divisions along the x and y axes.
- **Returns**:
  - `points`: Array of points in the mesh. Each point is a vertex of one or more triangles.
  - `triangles`: Array of triangles. Each triangle is defined by the indices of its vertices in the `points` array.
  - 
#### `create_delaunay_mesh(a, b, c, d, nx, ny)`
(not Used)
Generates a triangular mesh over a rectangular grid.
- **Parameters**: `a, b` (x-axis range), `c, d` (y-axis range), `nx, ny` (divisions along the x and y axes).
- **Returns**: `points` (2D array of points in the grid), `delaunay_tri.simplices` (the simplices, i.e., triangles, of the Delaunay triangulation).

#### `plot_mesh(points, triangles)`
Plots triangular mesh.
- **Parameters**: `points` (2D array of points in the grid), `triangles` (the simplices of the Delaunay triangulation).

#### `find_boundary_nodes(points, a, b, c, d)`
Identifies boundary nodes in a set of points within a rectangular region.
- **Parameters**: `points` (2D array of points), `a, b` (x-coordinate boundaries), `c, d` (y-coordinate boundaries).
- **Returns**: A sorted list of indices of points that lie on the boundary of the rectangle.

#### `compute_local_stiffness_matrix(coords)`
Calculates the local stiffness matrix for a triangular element. The local stiffness matrix $`K`$ for a triangle is calculated using the coordinates of its vertices. The general formula is:

$$
K_{ij} = \int_{\Omega} \nabla \phi_i \cdot \nabla \phi_j , d\Omega
$$

where $`phi_i`$ and $`\phi_j`$ are the linear shape functions associated with the triangle's nodes. The area $`\Omega`$ of the triangle is given by:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|
$$

This is used to compute the Local Matrix for a simple case Triangle = ([[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]) and then the generic local matrix is calculated via change of variables.

- **Parameters**: `points` (3x2 array with the (x, y) coordinates of the triangle's vertices).
- **Returns**: 3x3 local stiffness matrix.

#### `transform_stiffness_matrix(points, K_ref)`
Transforms a reference stiffness matrix into the stiffness matrix for a generic triangle. This transformation is necessary to adapt the stiffness matrix calculated for a reference triangle to any triangle in the domain. The transformation involves an affine mapping between the reference triangle and the generic triangle, which is described by a linear transformation and a translation.

The affine transformation is defined as follows:
- Let the vertices of the reference triangle be `A_ref`, `B_ref`, and `C_ref`, and the vertices of the generic triangle be `A`, `B`, and `C`.
- The transformation maps the vertices of the reference triangle to those of the generic triangle.
- This mapping can be represented by a matrix `T` such that `T * [A_ref; B_ref; C_ref] = [A; B; C]`.

The Jacobian $`J`$ of the transformation, which is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives, is used to transform the area element and the gradient of the shape functions. The determinant of the Jacobian $`\det(J)`$ represents the area scaling factor between the reference and the generic triangle.

The transformed stiffness matrix `K` for the generic triangle is then calculated using the formula:

$$
K = det(J) * {T^{(-1)}}^T * K_{ref} * T^{(-1)}
$$

where $`K_{ref}`$ is the stiffness matrix for the reference triangle.

- **Parameters**: `points` (coordinates of the generic triangle), `K_ref` (reference stiffness matrix).
- **Returns**: Transformed stiffness matrix for the generic triangle.

#### `assemble_global_stiffness_matrix(triangles, nodes, K_ref)`
Assembles the global stiffness matrix from the local stiffness matrices of triangles. The global stiffness matrix is a sparse matrix representing the entire FEM system. Each local stiffness matrix contributes to the global matrix at positions corresponding to the triangle's nodes.

- **Parameters**: `triangles` (list of triangles), `nodes` (node coordinates), `K_ref` (reference stiffness matrix).
- **Returns**: `lil_matrix`: Global stiffness matrix (expected to be a sparse matrix).


####  `compute_load_vector(f, nodes)`
Calculates the load vector for the finite element method. This function evaluates a given load function `f` at each node in the mesh and assembles the load vector.
- **Parameters**:
  - `f`: A function representing the load applied to the domain.
  - `nodes`: Array of node coordinates.
- **Returns**: Load vector as a NumPy array.

####  `apply_reduced_system_approach(stiffness_matrix, load_vector, boundary_nodes)`
Applies the reduced system approach to handle boundary conditions in the finite element method. This function modifies the stiffness matrix and the load vector by zeroing out the rows and columns corresponding to the boundary nodes, effectively removing them from the system.
- **Parameters**:
  - `stiffness_matrix`: The global stiffness matrix.
  - `load_vector`: The global load vector.
  - `boundary_nodes`: List of indices of boundary nodes.
- **Returns**: Reduced stiffness matrix and load vector, with boundary nodes eliminated.

####  `apply_boundary_conditions_penalty_method(stiffness_matrix, load_vector, boundary_nodes, M=1e10)`
(Not Used)
Applies boundary conditions using the penalty method. This method modifies the stiffness matrix by adding a large value `M` (penalty parameter) to the diagonal entries corresponding to the boundary nodes. This approach enforces the boundary conditions by making the corresponding rows and columns in the stiffness matrix dominant.
- **Parameters**:
  - `stiffness_matrix`: The global stiffness matrix.
  - `load_vector`: The global load vector.
  - `boundary_nodes`: List of indices of boundary nodes.
  - `M`: Penalty parameter (default is `1e10`).
- **Returns**: Modified stiffness matrix and load vector.
